class QUANTy(UsingClassifiers):
    """ Generic binary methods for quantiles-y method

        The idea is to represent the mixture of the training distribution and the testing distribution using
        quantiles of the predictions given by a classifier (y). The difference between both is minimized using a
        distance/loss function. This method encapsulates PAC quantifier (Bella et al. 2013). PAC has just 1 quantile
        and with this class you can define more quantiles and use any distance/loss to measure distribution similarity.
        The class has a parameter to select the distance used.

        This class (as every other class based on distribution matching using classifiers) works in two different ways:

        1) Two estimators are used to classify training examples and testing examples in order to
           compute the distribution of both sets. Estimators can be already trained

        2) You can directly provide the predictions for the examples in the fit/predict methods. This is useful
           for synthetic/artificial experiments

        The goal in both cases is to guarantee that all methods based on distribution matching are using **exactly**
        the same predictions when you compare this kind of quantifiers (and others that also employ an underlying
        classifier, for instance, CC/PCC and AC/PAC). In the first case, estimators are only trained once and can
        be shared for several quantifiers of this kind

        Multiclass quantification is not implemented yet for this object. It would need a more complex searching
        algorithm (instead golden_section_search)

        Parameters
        ----------
        estimator_train : estimator object (default=None)
            An estimator object implementing `fit` and `predict_proba`. It is used to classify the examples of the
            training set and to compute the distribution of each class individually

        estimator_test : estimator object (default=None)
            An estimator object implementing `fit` and `predict_proba`. It is used to classify the examples of the
            testing set and to compute the distribution of the whole testing set

        n_quantiles : int
            Number of quantiles

        distance : distance function (default=l2)
            It is the name of the distance used to compute the difference between the mixture of the training
            distribution and the testing distribution

        tol : float, (default=1e-05)
            The precision of the solution when search is used to compute the prevalence

        verbose : int, optional, (default=0)
            The verbosity level. The default value, zero, means silent mode

        For some experiments both estimator_train and estimator_test could be the same

        Attributes
        ----------
        estimator_train : estimator
            Estimator used to classify the examples of the training set

        estimator_test : estimator
            Estimator used to classify the examples of the testing bag

        predictions_train_ : ndarray, shape (n_examples, n_classes) (probabilities)
            Predictions of the examples in the training set

        predictions_test_ : ndarray, shape (n_examples, n_classes) (probabilities)
            Predictions of the examples in the testing bag

        needs_predictions_train : bool, True
            It is True because QUANTy quantifiers need to estimate the training distribution
            
        probabilistic_predictions : bool, True
            This means that predictions_train_/predictions_test_ contain probabilistic predictions

        classes_ : ndarray, shape (n_classes, )
            Class labels

        y_ext_ : ndarray, shape(len(predictions_train_, 1)
            Repmat of true labels of the training set. When CV_estimator is used with averaged_predictions=False,
            predictions_train_ will have a larger dimension (factor=n_repetitions * n_folds of the underlying CV)
            than y. In other cases, y_ext_ == y.
            y_ext_ i used in `fit`/`predict` method whenever the true labels of the training set are needed,
            instead of y

        n_quantiles : int (default=8)
            The number of quantiles to represent data distribution

        distance : A distance function (default=l2)
            The name of the distance function used

        tol : float
            The precision of the solution when search is used to compute the solution

        train_distrib_ : ndarray, shape (n_examples, 1) binary quantification
            Contains predictions_train_ in ascending order

        train_labels_ : ndarray, shape (n_examples, 1) binary quantification
            Contains the corresponding labels of the examples in train_distrib_ in the same order

        test_distrib_ : ndarray, shape (n_quantiles, 1)
            Contains the quantiles of the test distribution

        mixtures_ : ndarray, shape (101, n_quantiles)
            Contains the mixtures for all the prevalences in the range [0, 1] step=0.01. This speeds up the prediction
            for a collection of testing bags

        verbose : int
            The verbosity level

        Notes
        -----
        Notice that at least one between estimator_train/predictions_train and estimator_test/predictions_test
        must be not None. If both are None a ValueError exception will be raised. If both are not None,
        predictions_train/predictions_test are used

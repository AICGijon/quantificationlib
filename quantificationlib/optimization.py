        Notice that the last term is constant w.r.t prevalences.

        Let G = 2 train_distrib.T train_distrib  and a = 2 * train_distrib.T test_distrib, we can use directly

        Minimize     1/2 x^T G x - a^T x
        Subject to   C.T x >= b

        `solve_l2` just computes the term a, shape (n_classes,1), and then calls quadprog.solve_qp.
        G, C and b were computed by `compute_l2_param_train` before, in the 'fit' method` of the PDF/Friedman object.
        quadprog is used here because it is faster than cvxpy.
